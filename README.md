This is a budget tracking app. For this project, we were given the starter code for the functioning application and asked to add a service worker that will allow the user to interact with the app even with little or no internet connectivity. This app is also a Progressive Web Application (aka HTML-app or Web-app). This means that a user can install the app onto their desktop or mobile device for quick, offline access. In Google Chrome, click on the arrow/add button in the URL bar to download onto your desktop.

## Purpose

To track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
